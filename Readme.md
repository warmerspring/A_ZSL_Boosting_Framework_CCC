# Take the ZSL model LisGAN as an example, 
the code of a ZSLs boosting framework based on concept-constrained clustering is given.

# Six ZSL data sets are available at https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xian/xlsa17.zip.

# Instructions
Base model is lisgan.py. This code is provided by the author of the paper "Leveraging the Invariant Side of Generative Zero-Shot Learning"(downloaded by https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Li_Leveraging_the_Invariant_Side_of_Generative_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2019_paper.html).

If you want to obtain the LisGAN-OURS, please run lisgan_AWA2_GZSL_contraining.py.
